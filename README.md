# SLS Offline Auth bug

A small example project that demonstrates a bug in Serverless offline.

Running serverless offline we see an unauthorised message:
```sh
$ npx serverless offline
$ curl http://localhost:3000/dev
{"statusCode":401,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Unauthorized"}
```

## Expected behaviour

Running serverless offline with the `--useChildProcesses` flag results in the same behaviour.

## Actual behaviour

Running with the `--useChildProcesses` flag, the request hangs:

```sh
$ npx serverless offline --useChildProcesses
$ curl http://localhost:3000/dev
# The above request never completes
```

If you check the output from the serverless offline server, you will see the following:

```
